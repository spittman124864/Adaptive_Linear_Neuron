# Adaptive_Linear_Neuron
Python Code for an adaptive linear neuron that classifies a positive and negative class.

In the notebook, Adaptive_Linear_Neurons.ipynb, two linear neurons are presented.  The first neuron is based on the perceptron algorithm.  The second one is adaptive and adjusts weights by minimizing a cost function per epoch.  The neurons are both trained and tested on the Iris Data set.

The notebook, Linear_Neuron_With_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent.ipynb, presents an adaptive linear neuron uses Stochastic Gradient Descent to adjust the weights. The AdalineSGDeta has the option to have an adaptive learning rate eta.  If this option is chosen, the learning rate eta monotonically decreases after each iteration, which promotes further annealing.  The neurons are both trained and tested on the Iris Data set.
